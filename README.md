## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find the configurations and instructions to deploy a microservice application with Kubernetes. We'll start with a manual deployment using raw Kubernetes manifests and then streamline the process using Helm. I will deploy the Google's microservice demo application, since it has 10 microservices and it demonstrates the microservices architecture very well.
You can find the repository to the application here.
